## Required information I added to the form

**Title:** NASA GeneLab 2023 Amplicon Sequencing Workshop

**Public overview:**  

> General overview
>
> NASA GeneLab (https://genelab.nasa.gov/), out of NASA's Ames Research Center in northern California, is a comprehensive space-related omics database that in addition to providing raw data also provides processed datasets to the public in an effort to increase reach and accessibility. Training is a part of our purpose as well through programs such as GeneLab for Colleges and Universities (GL4U; https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-Training/tree/main/GL4U). As part of GL4U, we are putting on a 4-5 day workshop teaching how to process and analyze amplicon data this summer working with students from a Minority Serving Institution (MSI). 
>
> How we plan to use ACCESS resources
> 
> We will be running one 4-5 day computational workshop, covering introductions to amplicon sequencing, jupyter lab and notebooks, the unix-like command line, and R, followed by processing and analyzing a spaceflight amplicon dataset. I have been fortunate enough to receive XSEDE and then ACCESS resources for several workshop/educations scenarios over the past, and it has been invaluable for being able to provide the same computational capabilities in an easy-to-access manner for all participants.
> 
> I have experience in the past doing this through Indiana Jetstream2, managing through Exosphere, so that would be great if possible. We are requesting the ability to run 30 m3.medium instances concurrently for 8 days straight. This is longer than we plan on them being active, but would like to leave room for building the image and testing ahead of time, and in case any users don't shut them down when expected. Using the jetstream estimator (https://wiki.jetstream-cloud.org/alloc/estimator/), with 30 m3.medium instances for 8 days, this comes out to a request for 46,080 SUs/ACCESS Credits.  Please let me know if I should be estimating a different way or if any other information is needed.

> Thanks for your consideration and any help!

Once approved, and logged in, needed this page (https://allocations.access-ci.org/requests) in order to transfer ACCESS credits to specific resource as detailed on this page (https://allocations.access-ci.org/use-credits-overview). For the appropriate allocation request, selected "Choose New Action", then "Exchange". On next screen, chose Indiana Jetstream2 as Resource, clicked "Add Resource", entered all credits, needed to add a comment, and then submitted.
